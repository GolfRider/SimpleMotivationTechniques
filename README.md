### How to build Discipline
    1. Set short term goals (2 weeks etc)   
        [Or break your long term goals into set of short term goals]
    2. Reward yourself after every short term goal completion
        [Like going out,watching movie,playing sports etc]
    3. Once committed, don't get distracted,stay focussed
        [You should not even listen to your mind/heart in this intense period]
    4. Do the action
    5. Learning any new habit takes 6 weeks time,after that it becomes natural/effortless
    6. Wake up early everyday
    7. There is no escape route/easy route [or shortcut to success,it is hard]
